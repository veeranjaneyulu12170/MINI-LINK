# Google Authentication Fix

This document explains the changes made to fix the Google authentication issues in the application.

## Issues Fixed

1. **500 Internal Server Error**: The backend server was encountering TypeScript errors when processing Google authentication requests.
2. **Token Verification Issues**: The backend was having trouble verifying Google tokens in some cases.
3. **Unreliable Primary Authentication Method**: The primary Google Sign-In method was less reliable than the alternative method.

## Changes Made

### Backend Changes

1. **Fixed TypeScript Errors**: Added proper type annotations and error handling in the `auth.ts` file.
2. **Improved Token Verification**: Updated the Google authentication route to handle different types of tokens (ID tokens and access tokens).
3. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Added more detailed error logging and responses to help diagnose issues.
4. **Added Test Script**: Created a test script (`backend/test-google-token.js`) to verify Google tokens without affecting the database.

### Frontend Changes

1. **Using Alternative Method by Default**: Updated the Login component to use the more reliable alternative Google Sign-In method by default.
2. **Improved Error Handling**: Enhanced error handling in the auth service and Login component to provide better feedback to users.
3. **Removed Redundant UI**: Removed the "Try Alternative Google Sign-In" button since we're using the alternative method by default.
4. **Added Backend Connection Testing**: Added a test button to check the backend connection when there's a network error.

## How to Test

1. **Start the Backend Server**:
   ```
   cd backend
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Start the Frontend**:
   ```
   cd src
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Test Google Sign-In**:
   - Open the application in your browser
   - Click the "Continue with Google" button
   - Complete the Google authentication flow
   - You should be redirected to the app page after successful authentication

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues with Google authentication:

1. **Check the Backend Logs**: Look at the terminal where the backend server is running for detailed error messages.

2. **Test the Backend Connection**:
   ```
   node test-backend.js
   ```

3. **Test Google Token Verification**:
   ```
   cd backend
   node test-google-token.js <your-token>
   ```

4. **Check Your Google Cloud Console Configuration**:
   - Make sure your Google Cloud project is properly configured
   - Verify that the OAuth consent screen is set up correctly
   - Ensure the correct scopes are enabled (email, profile)
   - Check that the OAuth client ID is configured with the right redirect URIs

5. **Clear Browser Cache and Cookies**: Sometimes, clearing your browser cache and cookies can resolve authentication issues.
